# multiplayertest
A server-client model multiplayer test. Every client have a username and a cube to move around.

A basic multiplayer test made by me, uses port connection. Have some issues with showing usernames, I also tried to fix it via forums and ChatGPT. But this is the best i can make.

My youtube video about it:
